Simple Image Viewer - By Christopher Wong

This is my final project for CS-385. 

I chose to do one of the recommended projects, the simple image viewer 
that allows panning, zooming and rotation. Currently I'm not using any 
special software and have composed my project using html, javascript 
and the features that come with them. 

My project consists of: 
	Panning
	Zooming
	Rotation
	Image Upload
